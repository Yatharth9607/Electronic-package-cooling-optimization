# Electronic-package-cooling-optimization
Model development using numerical methods for CFD and FEA analysis of ball grid array and detailed optimization analysis using algorithms

A brief summary of the files in this project is as follows:

1. `Electronic Package Cooling Optimization Report.pdf`
Comprehensive report on the design optimization using gradient-based and heuristics-based methods for a Ball Grid Array and post-optimality analysis.

## Work in progress

-> developing interactive python modules for the matlab files to directly execute without MATLAB
